### **Main Series**
1. ***Kirby's Dream Land*** (1992, Game Boy): Kirby's first adventure is a straightforward platformer where he must recover stolen food from King Dedede. The game established Kirby's ability to inhale enemies but did not yet include his copy abilities.

Traditional Kirby mechanics, such as inhaling enemies, are replaced with innovative ways to manipulate the fabric-based world. The game received acclaim for its imaginative art style and relaxing gameplay.
5. ***Kirby Planet Robobot*** (2016, Nintendo 3DS): This game introduced mech suits called Robobots, which Kirby could pilot to access new abilities and traverse levels in unique ways. The combination of traditional Kirby gameplay and the mechanized enhancements provided a fresh experience for fans.
6. ***Kirby Star Allies*** (2018, Nintendo Switch): Focused on cooperative play, this game allows Kirby to befriend enemies by throwing hearts at them, turning them into allies. The game emphasizes teamwork, enabling players to combine abilities for powerful effects.
7. ***Kirby and the Forgotten Land*** (2022, Nintendo Switch): A 3D platformer that takes Kirby to an expansive world filled with secrets and challenges.
